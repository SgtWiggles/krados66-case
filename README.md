## Description

A custom 3D printed case for the Krado 66 (<https://www.kradoindustries.com/product/krado66-skeleton-case>)

It was designed in a weekend for a friend's keyboard. While the CAD render has a black bottom, in the final printed version the top was printed out of a mint green PLA and the bottom was printed in transparent PETG to allow the underglow to shine through.
